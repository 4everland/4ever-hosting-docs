# REST API

The API, based on the 4everland platform, offers easy access, fully-featured, stable performance, and flexible service. You can deploy your custom projects by integrating them with your existing projects using the API, according to the documentation.

## API Basics

Our API is exposed as an HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 service over SSL. All endpoints live under the URL<font color='cornflowerblue'>'https://cli-api.4everland.org/'</font>
and then generally follow the REST architecture.
