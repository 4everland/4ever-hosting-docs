This document will introduce how to log in to 4ever-hosting through a Github account. Before starting, please make sure that you have a Github account and have logged in.

## Step1: Login via github

In many places on 4everland, you can find the login entrance. A 4ever-hosting account will be easily created when you click on login, then authorize.
