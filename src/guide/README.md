# Introduction

## 4EVERLAND

4EVERLAND is a Web3.0 cloud computing platform with global acceleration, privacy protection, distributed storage and other technical features.

## 4EVER-HOSTING

4EVER-HOSTING is an application for developers that can be
accessed from the official website of 4EVERLAND. Developers can deploy
DWeb to the 4EVERLAND gateway through the visual interface (Hosting App)
or the command line ([@4everland/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4everland/cluster-cli)). All nodes in 4EVERLAND can provide
persistent storage for the DWeb, and all gateways can provide acceleration for
the DWeb.

## Deploy an Existing Project

Once you have signed up to 4EVER-HOSTING, you can use GitHub to deploy an existing project – then with a deployment for every push – by selecting a repository from your Git account.

Connect through the ["New Project"](https://hosting.4everland.org/new) page under the "Import Git Repository" section, and then from the same place, set up a Project to get automatic Deployments via Git.

Alternatively, if you want to start fresh with a new project, use a Quickstart template from below. Additionally, you can use this method to start a new Git repository on [GitHub](../guide/github.md)
